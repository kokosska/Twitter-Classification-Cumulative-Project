# Twitter Classification Cumulative Project
 
This is a project launched at Codecademy and it is a part of Data Scientist Career Path. 

VIRAL TWEETS - In this project, I am going to use the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to predict whether a tweet will go viral.

TWEET LOCATION - I will use a Naive Bayes Classifier to find patterns in real tweets. The goal is to create a classification algorithm that can classify any tweet (or sentence) and predict whether that sentence came from New York, London, or Paris.
